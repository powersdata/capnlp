This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
require(tau)

queryHistoryTab <- c("Can of beer" = 3, "can of Soda" = 2, "A can of water" = 1, "Buy me a can of soda, please" = 2)
queryHistoryTab <- trigram
query <- "can of"
n <- 2
idx <- which(substr(trigram$nGram, 0, nchar(query)) == query)
res <- head(names(sort(trigram[idx,1], decreasing = TRUE)), n)

tst <- length(scan(text = query, what = "character", quiet = TRUE))+1

trigrams <- textcnt(queryHistoryTab$nGram, method = "string", tst)

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
f <- function(queryHistoryTab, query, n = 2) {
  require(tau)
  trigrams <- sort(textcnt(rep(tolower(names(queryHistoryTab)), queryHistoryTab), method = "string", n = length(scan(text = query, what = "character", quiet = TRUE)) + 1))
  query <- tolower(query)
  idx <- which(substr(names(trigrams), 0, nchar(query)) == query)
  res <- head(names(sort(trigrams[idx], decreasing = TRUE)), n)
  res <- substr(res, nchar(query) + 2, nchar(res))
  return(res)
}
f(c("Can of beer" = 3, "can of Soda" = 2, "A can of water" = 1, "Buy me a can of soda, please" = 2), "i do ")
# [1] "soda" "beer"
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache = FALSE, results="markup", fig.width=4.2, fig.height=4}
#find text
query <- "can of soda"
#compare to quadrigram
idx <- grepl(query, quadgram$nGram, ignore.case = TRUE)

#sort quad based on text and frequency
xgram <- quadgram[idx,]
xgram <- xgram[order(xgram$Freq, decreasing = TRUE),]
head(xgram, 10)



```
